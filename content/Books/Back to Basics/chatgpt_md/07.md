# Colored vs Monochrome Fringes

**人類:**
Optical Methods in Experimental Mechanics Part 7: Colored Interferometry Fringes PURPOSE The topic of classical interferometries is not yet exhausted, but this is a good time to digress a bit and answer questions as to why interference fringe patterns are sometimes monochrome and sometimes brilliantly colored, and also to explore the uses of these patterns. CONTEXT Suppose you are demonstrating some interferometric process, such as photoelasticity, using an overhead projector, and you are projecting the fringe pattern on a screen. Experience suggests that the audience will be delighted by the rippling flow of brightly colored interference fringes, and some might be so impressed that they decide to follow a career in experimental mechanics. Later in the demonstration you might use a laser to show another type of interferometry, and the fringes will be monochromatic; or you might show a black and white fringe picture that you have used for precise quantitative analysis. The audience will likely ask why some patterns are colored and some are monochrome, and they might wonder why you waste time with the monochromatic patterns when you can create amusing colored ones. A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT To help us understand the formation of colored fringes, consider a thought experiment. We set up a system that is similar to the generic interferometer that was discussed in Part 3 of this series. Imagine that we can control the path length difference (PLD). We use for illumination a single wavelength of light such as from a laser. Suppose that we begin by using a laser that emits blue light at a wavelength of 440 nm. We connect the detector in the interferometer to a plotter that displays intensity as a function of the PLD. We know from our study of this problem (see Part 2) that we will obtain a plot of intensity versus PLD, such as is shown by the blue trace in the bottom portion of Fig. 1. Whenever the PLD is a multiple of the 440 nm wavelength, the intensity will be zero. Now, suppose we exchange the blue laser for one that emits red light at 660 nm wavelength. The experiment is repeated. The trace of intensity versus PLD will match the red trace in the figure, with zero intensity whenever the PLD is a multiple of 660 nm. Suppose, finally, that we put both lasers into the setup and do the measurements again with simultaneous red and blue illumination. The plotter will display the sum of both the traces obtained when the lasers were used separately. This resultant intensity trace is not reproduced in the figure, but it is easy to visualize qualitatively 解釋

在光學干涉實驗中，干涉條紋（或稱干涉線）的顏色取決於多個因素，主要是光源的波長和光路差（Path Length Difference, PLD）。

### 單色和多色干涉

1.  **單色干涉**：當使用單一波長的光源（如激光）進行實驗時，產生的干涉條紋會是單色的。這是因為光的波長是恆定的，所以當PLD是該波長的倍數時，會出現明暗相間的條紋。
    
2.  **多色干涉**：當使用多波長的光源（如白光）進行實驗時，會看到多彩的干涉條紋。這是因為不同波長的光會在不同的PLD下產生干涉，因此會看到多種顏色。
    

### 思考實驗

在您描述的思考實驗中：

*   使用藍色激光（440 nm）：當PLD是440 nm的倍數時，會出現暗區（強度為零）。
*   使用紅色激光（660 nm）：當PLD是660 nm的倍數時，會出現暗區（強度為零）。
*   使用紅色和藍色激光：實驗的結果會是兩個條紋模式的疊加。這意味著在某些PLD下，紅色和藍色光可能會構成明暗不同的條紋，或者甚至產生紫色的條紋（紅+藍）。

### 為什麼單色也有用？

單色干涉條紋通常用於精確的量測和分析，因為它們不受多種波長干擾的影響。多色干涉條紋或許看起來更吸引人，但它們在量測精度上可能會有所損失。

總之，單色和多色干涉各有其用途和優點，選擇哪一種取決於實驗的需求和目的。

More illuminating is to imagine that we replace the intensity detector with a sensor that responds to color, such as a color camera or our eye. This sensor will yield, at each PLD, the color that is created by adding the blue and red components that were recorded individually at that PLD. For example, at a PLD of around 300 nm, approximately equal intensities of blue and red are passed through, and they add to create purple or magenta, which is the color that is perceived. For a PLD of around 700 nm, most of the red is eliminated by interference, so we are left with a lot of blue, meaning that we perceive a blue with a slight purple cast. The rainbow-like color bar at the top of the figure shows the resultant color that is perceived as the PLD is increased when the two wavelengths are used simultaneously, as suggested above. Here, the total intensities are not correct, but the hue is pretty close to true value. Observe first that the sequence of colors is not all that simple, even though we are using only two wavelengths that were purposely chosen to keep the color pattern as tidy as possible (660 nm  1.5 440 nm). Let us explain the different colors observed by visualizing the superimposition of the two intensity plots and remembering that we are dealing with light and not pigments. • At zero PLD, there is no light, so we start from black. • As the PLD increases from zero to about 220 nm, approximately equal amounts of red and blue are mixed, so we see a slowly changing purple that becomes more intense as the amplitudes increase. • Beyond 220 nm PLD, the blue begins to drop off while red stays strong, so the purple fades quickly into red. • At 440 nm, the blue is canceled by destructive interference, so only red remains. • Between 440 and 660 nm, the blue increases while red drops off, so we have a short band of rapidly changing purple that is getting more blue. • At 660 nm, the red is canceled, so we perceive pure blue. • Between 660 nm and 1320 nm the sequence just described is reversed. • At 1320 nm  2 660 nm  3 440 nm, both red and blue undergo total destructive interference, so we finally get back to black. • Between 1320 nm and 2640 nm PLD, the whole sequence of colors is repeated. • And so on.

您描述的思考實驗對於理解如何生成彩色干涉條紋非常有用。這裡我們不僅僅看到光強度的變化，還看到了顏色的變化，這是因為兩種不同波長的光（紅色和藍色）被用於實驗。

### 視覺感知和光的疊加

當使用一個可以感應顏色的傳感器（如彩色攝像頭或我們的眼睛）來替換強度檢測器時，我們會觀察到不同的現象：

*   **在 PLD = 0 時**：兩種光都沒有，所以起始點是黑色。
*   **在 PLD = 220 nm 附近**：紅色和藍色光的強度大致相等，因此我們會看到漸變的紫色。
*   **在 PLD > 220 nm 之後**：藍色光強度減弱，紅色光強度仍然強，因此顏色快速從紫色變為紅色。
*   **在 PLD = 440 nm 時**：藍色光因為破壞性干涉被消除，只剩下紅色。
*   **在 440 nm 和 660 nm 之間**：藍色光強度增加，紅色光強度減少，因此我們會看到一個快速變化的紫色區域。
*   **在 PLD = 660 nm 時**：紅色光被消除，所以我們感知到純藍色。

### 複雜性和模式重複

這樣的顏色變化模式會在 PLD = 1320 nm（即 $2 \times 660 \, \text{nm} = 3 \times 440 \, \text{nm}$）處重複，然後在 PLD = 2640 nm 處再次重複，依此類推。

這個實驗解釋了為什麼我們會在使用多波長光源時看到彩色的干涉條紋。這種彩色條紋不僅僅是視覺上吸引人，它們也提供了有關光路差和光波干涉的豐富信息。然而，正如您所提到的，顏色的變化並不簡單，即使在這個實驗中我們特意選擇了只有兩種波長的光源。

這種理解有助於我們更好地解釋和控制實驗條件，並可以應用於各種需要精確光學測量的場合。

The photograph appearing with this article suggests that these predictions are valid. The color sequence in the experiment is not quite the same because the two wavelengths used were different from those used in the thought experiment. An obvious question is, ‘‘For any given PLD, what is the fringe order?’’ No truly meaningful answer to this question presents itself. At PLD  3960 nm, we have migrated through 3 cycles of pure blue, 6 cycles of pure red, 4 cycles of black (counting the zero), and no less than 12 cycles of purple. Unless you name a wavelength or color, the concept of fringe counting has no meaning. Furthermore, notice that the cycles of certain colors (purple in this case) are not necessarily evenly spaced. This is one reason why colored fringe patterns, while very nice to look at and impress managers with, have not often been used for quantitative analysis. Imagine doing the thought experiment with some form of interferometry that creates a large field where the PLD varies continuously over the field. The experiment can involve the oblique intersection of two beams (Part 4 of this series), Newton’s fringes (Part 5), Young’s fringes (Part 6), photoelasticity (not discussed yet), or any one of several other possibilities. The PLD at each point in the field will give rise to a specific color according to the rules described above. Further, if the PLD varies smoothly over the field, then the colors will also vary smoothly, hence, a ‘‘colored fringe’’ pattern. An immense question remains. What happens if more than two wavelengths are used, or even a continuous spectrum? Repeating the thought experiment with 3 separate wavelengths is entertaining, instructive, and time-consuming. For four or more wavelengths, the problem gets out of hand, partly because you run out of wavelengths in the narrow visible spectrum that have nice mathematical proportions. Better to go to the lab with color filters or spectral sources, a photoelasticity model, and some means of judging colors. With continuous spectrum illumination you will see the complement of whatever colors are canceled by destructive interference. For PLD’s beyond the first cycle, the problem gets very tricky. For example, the third cancellation of blue matches the second cancellation of red, as we found in our experiment, and you have left white light that has both red and blue removed, with the remaining colors mixed in uneven proportions. Black will not be seen again. The sequence of colors is no longer cyclic as it was in our thought experiment, and the colors lose saturation, tending to pastel shades and eventually to white. Various investigators have published charts of resultant color versus PLD for ideal white-light illumination (sunlight or equivalent). One such chart appears in Spannungsoptik by G. Mesmer, Springer-Verlag, 1939; this chart is reproduced in Optical Methods of Engineering Analysis by Gary Cloud, Cambridge University Press, 1995 and 1998, p98. The catch is that it is very difficult to reproduce sunlight. The colors observed are dependent on the color spectrum in the actual illuminating beam, the transmittance spectra for the optical components and the specimen, and also the precision with which one is able to record or judge color, itself a difficult task. These difficulties are the second reason why colored fringes are not usually used for quantitative measurement. The third difficulty with color methods results from the way refractive index varies with wavelength, a phenomenon called dispersion. That said, colored fringes do have important uses. For one thing, the color sequence is very useful in establishing the direction of the gradient of fringe orders in whole-field work, thereby helping solve the vexing problem of fringe counting. Interpolation between whole-order fringes can also be facilitated by using colors. In recent years, the advent of color video cameras and digital processing has led to a resurgence of interest in the use of colored fringes in interferometry, especially in what is often called RGB photoelasticity. Such systems can be calibrated to account for the color balance in the light source and sensors, eliminate the effects of color absorption in the specimen, and also eliminate errors caused by dispersion. These methods are now practical for obtaining accurate results, especially when fringe orders are small, from colored interferometric patterns that once were used primarily to impress layfolk and add cosmetic appeal to engineering reports. In a way, the story of colored fringes has come full circle. It is likely that the earliest fringe patterns observed by Thomas Young and others were created with near-white light (candles, arc lamps). Then, spectral sources became available; and, given the problems in judging color and so on, most serious interferometric measurements were done with monochromatic light. Color video cameras and digital processing make it possible to analyze accurately the spectral content of light; and, so, we return to the use of broadband illumination and colored fringes for accurate analysis.

您的詳細說明觸及了許多與彩色干涉條紋相關的複雜問題和應用。以下是一些主要觀點的摘要：

### 干涉條紋順序的問題

確實，除非指定波長或顏色，否則“干涉條紋的順序是多少？”這個問題沒有實質性的答案。這是因為不同顏色（即不同波長）的光在不同的光路差（PLD）下會產生不同的干涉模式。

### 用於定量分析的挑戰

彩色干涉條紋雖然視覺上吸引人，但由於顏色循環不均勻和光學元件的色散等因素，它們很少用於定量分析。

### 現代技術的影響

隨著彩色視頻攝像頭和數字處理技術的出現，RGB光彈性學和其他使用彩色干涉條紋的方法正在重新受到關注。這些系統可以校準來消除光源和傳感器中的顏色平衡問題，也可以消除由於色散引起的誤差。

### 寬頻照明的回歸

如您所述，最初的干涉模式可能是用接近白光（如蠟燭、弧燈等）創建的。由於評價顏色等問題的挑戰，大多數嚴肅的干涉測量都是用單色光進行的。然而，現代的色彩視頻攝像頭和數字處理技術使我們能夠準確地分析光的光譜內容，因此，我們返回到使用寬頻照明和彩色干涉條紋進行精確分析。

總體而言，彩色干涉條紋的研究和應用已經“轉了一圈”，回到了其起點，但這次是以更先進和精確的方式。這些方法現在已經足夠實用，能夠從那些原本主要用於給人留下深刻印象和美化工程報告的彩色干涉模式中獲得準確的結果。

Detail from light-field photoelastic interferometry fringe pattern obtained using simultaneous illumination from two laser sources: Argon at 488 nm (turquoise) and Helium-Neon at 633 nm (red). The granular appearance is caused by laser speckle. Photo by Gary Cloud, March 2003. • Why do we see a brilliant pattern of colored interference fringes in some experiments? • What do these colored patterns mean? • What are their uses? We create a thought experiment: • involving some type of interferometer • a choice of red or blue illumination is provided • the PLD is controllable • the intensity detector output is plotted as a function of PLD for each wavelength The detector output shows that the intensities for red and blue oscillate between zero and maximum at different rates, depending on the wavelength used for illumination. The experiment is then performed with the following changes: • combined red and blue illumination is provided • a color sensor is substituted for the intensity detector. The sensor yields a resultant color that is created by the mixture of red and blue components remaining at each PLD. If color is plotted with increasing PLD we will see a sort of color spectrum that is fairly complex even though only two wavelengths were used in the experiment. As PLD increases from 0 to 1320 nm, the sequence of colors is: • black slowly shading through purple to red • red shading quickly through purple to blue • blue shading quickly through purple to red • red shading slowly through purple to black, where minima of both blue and red are reached • the color cycle repeats for each successive segment of 1320 nm PLD. • for each black-to-black segment, we pass through one stage of pure blue, two stages of pure red, and 4 stages of purple shades. Our usual concept of fringe counting does not apply to colored fringe patterns. • we must count in terms of the cycles of a certain color • for some colors, the cycles are not evenly spaced. If more than one wavelength of illumination is used in a whole-field interferometer, then we observe a field of colored fringes. If several wavelengths are used, predicting the resultant colors over a range of PLD’s becomes quite difficult. For continuous spectrum illumination in an interferometer: • the fringe colors are the complement of whatever colors destructively interfere at any PLD • for PLD’s beyond the first cycle, predicting and interpreting the color sequence is difficult • the color sequence is no longer repetitive or periodic • for large PLD’s the various colors combine in ways that cause the saturation to diminish, producing pastels that eventually tend to white—no colors. Fringe colors depend on: • the spectral content of the source • the transmittance spectra of the optical components and specimen • the color rendition or accuracy of the observing device Colored interferometric fringes: • are not often used for quantitative analysis by themselves • help us in fringe counting by showing the fringe gradient • help with interpolation between fringes. Colored fringe information is now put to good effect in electronic forms of interferometry including, for example, RGB photoelasticity

您提供了一個非常詳細和全面的說明，涵蓋了彩色干涉條紋在實驗力學中的各個方面。以下是對您觀點的整理：

### 為什麼我們在某些實驗中看到鮮艷的彩色干涉條紋？

這主要是由於使用了多個波長的光源，並且這些波長在不同的光路差（PLD）下會產生不同的干涉模式。當這些不同的干涉模式疊加在一起時，就會產生彩色的干涉條紋。

### 這些彩色條紋意味著什麼？

彩色干涉條紋提供了關於光路差和光波干涉的信息。然而，除非指定波長或顏色，否則使用傳統的干涉條紋計數方法是沒有意義的。

### 它們有什麼用途？

儘管彩色干涉條紋很少用於定量分析，但它們在整個場域內顯示干涉條紋梯度的方向方面非常有用，這有助於解決干涉條紋計數的問題。此外，它們還有助於干涉條紋之間的插值。

### 更複雜的情況

*   使用多於一個波長的照明會使預測結果變得相當困難。
*   在連續光譜照明下，顏色序列不再是重複或周期性的，並且在大的PLD下，顏色會因飽和度降低而趨向於白色。

### 影響因素

*   光源的光譜內容
*   光學元件和樣本的透射光譜
*   觀察設備的顏色還原或準確性

### 現代應用

現代的電子干涉術，如RGB光彈性學，已經使得從彩色干涉模式中獲得準確結果變得實用。

總之，彩色干涉條紋在實驗力學和其他科學領域中具有廣泛的應用前景，特別是隨著數字影像處理和其他先進技術的發展。它們提供了一種視覺上吸引人同時也充滿信息的方式來研究和理解光的干涉現象。
